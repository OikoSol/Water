In this category, I will list some of the technologies that can harvest and treat water in an urban environment with limited space available for human consumption and for other uses (growing food, treating waste, use in lavatories, etc)

* **Rainwater collector**: A rainwater collector is an object which harvests stormwater from precipitation events into a reservoir for later use or further treatment.
* **Water filter**: A water filter is a device which removes unwanted solids and/or microsolids from water in order to make it safe for human use.
* **Solar still**: A solar still is a device using solar energy to evaporate contaminated water and to condensate it into distilled water.
* **Dew condenser**: A dew condenser is a device that can condense moisture from the air into liquid water.
